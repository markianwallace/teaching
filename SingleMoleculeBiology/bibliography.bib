	abstract = {Photon bursts from single diffusing donor-acceptor labeled macromolecules were used to measure intramolecular distances and identify subpopulations of freely diffusing macromolecules in a heterogeneous ensemble. By using DNA as a rigid spacer, a series of constructs with varying intramolecular donor-acceptor spacings were used to measure the mean and distribution width of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies as a function of distance. The mean single-pair FRET efficiencies qualitatively follow the distance dependence predicted by Förster theory. Possible contributions to the widths of the FRET efficiency distributions are discussed, and potential applications in the study of biopolymer conformational dynamics are suggested. The ability to measure intramolecular (and intermolecular) distances for single molecules implies the ability to distinguish and monitor subpopulations of molecules in a mixture with different distances or conformational states. This is demonstrated by monitoring substrate and product subpopulations before and after a restriction endonuclease cleavage reaction. Distance measurements at single-molecule resolution also should facilitate the study of complex reactions such as biopolymer folding. To this end, the denaturation of a DNA hairpin was examined by using single-pair FRET.},

We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 ± 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

abstract = {We investigate photoblinking and photobleaching of perylene diimide (PDI) and its higher homologue terrylene diimide (TDI). Single molecule fluorescence trajectories of the dye molecules embedded in PMMA under ambient conditions exhibit "on"-"off" blinking in the time range from ms to s. Due to the limited statistics of individual trajectories we construct ensemble distributions of "on" and "off" times which follow power laws with similar power law coefficients (m(on) ≈ 1.18, m(off) ≈ 1.31). The blinking is attributed to reversible formation of radical cations which are presumably created by electron transfer from higher excited triplet states T(n) of the molecules to acceptor levels in the PMMA host. This view is corroborated by the properties of TDI, which blinks at an excitation wavelength of 520 nm but does not at lower energy excitation (647 nm). In line with this observation, T(1)-T(n) absorption data of TDI (and PDI) indicate that above a certain illumination wavelength population of higher excited triplet states T(n) does not occur, preventing blinking. It is furthermore argued that the long-lived dark ("off") states, i.e. the radical cations, are precursors for the photobleaching process of the dye molecules. Consequently, the photobleaching quantum yield Y(bl) for TDI is very small at an excitation wavelength of 647 nm (Y(bl) = 2 × 10(-10)) but increases by two orders of magnitude at 520 nm (Y(bl) = 2 × 10(-8)), which lies in the range observed for PDI investigated with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Additional studies of a PDI-TDI donor-acceptor dyad give further insights into the blinking and bleaching processes. Important findings include the observation of power law blinking of TDI and PDI (after bleaching of TDI) with similar coefficients as found for the isolated chromophores. Furthermore, in the dyad the photostability of TDI decreases due to efficient population of the states T(n) by singlet-triplet annihilation, while that of PDI (after bleaching of TDI) is the same as for the isolated dye. These findings support the conclusions drawn for the isolated chromophores, in particular the involvement of the triplet manifold in the blinking (and bleaching) behavior.}

In the SPT technique, the receptor molecules are labeled with 40 nm-phi colloidal gold particles, and their movements are followed by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy at a temporal resolution of 33 ms and at a nanometer-level spatial precision. The trajectories of the receptor molecules obtained by SPT were analyzed by developing a method that is based on the plot of the mean-square displacement against time. Four characteristic types of motion were observed: (a) stationary mode, in which the microscopic diffusion coefficient is less than 4.6 x 10(-12) cm2/s; (b) simple Brownian diffusion mode; (c) directed diffusion mode, in which unidirectional movements are superimposed on random motion; and (d) confined diffusion mode, in which particles undergoing Brownian diffusion (microscopic diffusion coefficient between 4.6 x 10(-12) and 1 x 10(-9) cm2/s) are confined within a limited area, probably by the membrane-associated cytoskeleton network. Comparison of these data obtained by SPT with those obtained by FPR suggests that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized into many small domains 300-600 nm in diameter (0.04-0.24 microns2 in area), in which receptor molecules are confined in the time scale of 3-30 s, and that the long-range diffusion observed by FPR can occur by successive movements of the receptors to adjacent compartments. Calcium-induced differentiation decreases the sum of the percentages of molecules in the directed diffusion and the stationary modes outside of the cell-cell contact regions on the cell surface (which is proposed to be the percentage of E-cadherin bound to the cytoskeleton/membrane-skeleton), from approximately 60\% to 8\% (low- and high-calcium mediums, respectively).}

abstract = {The giant protein titin, which is responsible for passive elasticity in muscle fibers, is built from approximately 300 regular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and FN-III repeats. While the soft elasticity derived from its entropic regions, as well as the stiff mechanical resistance derived from the unfolding of the secondary structure elements of Ig- and FN-III domains have been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanical elasticity stemming from the orientation of neighboring domains relative to each other. Here we address the dynamics and energetics of interdomain arrangement of two adjacent Ig-domains of titin, Z1, and Z2, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal conformational flexibility, due to the domain-domain geometry, that lends an intermediate force elasticity to titin. We employ adaptive biasing force MD simulations to calculate the energy required to bend the Z1Z2 tandem open to identify energetically feasible interdomain arrangements of the Z1 and Z2 domains. The finding is cast into a stochastic model for Z1Z2 interdomain elasticity that is generalized to a multiple domain chain replicating many Z1Z2-like units and representing a long titin segment. The elastic properties of this chain suggest that titin derives so-called tertiary structure elasticity from bending and twisting of its domains. Finally, we employ steered molecular dynamics simulations to stretch individual Z1 and Z2 domains and characterize the so-called secondary structure elasticity of the two domains. Our study suggests that titin's overall elastic response at weak force stems from a soft entropic spring behavior (not described here), from tertiary structure elasticity with an elastic spring constant of approximately 0.001-1 pN/A and, at strong forces, from secondary structure elasticity.}

abstract = {We have analyzed the dynamics of the chaperonin (GroEL)-cochaperonin (GroES) interaction at the single-molecule level. In the presence of ATP and non-native protein, binding of GroES to the immobilized GroEL occurred at a rate that is consistent with bulk kinetics measurements. However, the release of GroES from GroEL occurred after a lag period ( approximately 3 s) that was not recognized in earlier bulk-phase studies. This observation suggests a new kinetic intermediate in the GroEL-GroES reaction pathway.}
